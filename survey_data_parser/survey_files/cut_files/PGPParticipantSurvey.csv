huD7960A,60-69 years,I am comfortable making my genome sequence data publicly available without prior review.,Yes,I have a disorder that falls within the phenotype of a severe form of hypokalemic periodic paralysis. It seems to have an autosomal dominant pattern on my father's side of the family, and includes daily weakness and loss-of-consciousness episodes coming from food.  For me, there is also documented full-body paralysis including full breathing paralysis (causing an emergency) and many other abnormal and severe reactions to many common hospital medications. 

Like other forms of hypokalemic periodic paralysis, CNS symptoms and pancreatic symptoms, all in response to food. There are many severe medication reactions, of course.

I have had genetic tests for the most common genes for periodic paralysis

I have been told that the cause is most likely a medically new channelopathy. If so

My own feeling is that the disorder is more severe for me because of the effects of several genes, which could explain why I have such severe symptoms.
,Very severe disease,Yes, I have one or more affected relatives who have expressed an interest,Yes,No,Yes,1. I have a letter from the anesthesiologist who describes one of my paralytic reactions that caused breathing paralysis, and what he did about it. 

2. I have EKG's from a Holter test that document unusual cardiac reactions. Before eating, where the resting heart rate rose to 128 bpm and there were many arrhythmias and irregularities. The EKG's didn't even look like EKG's anymore. The episodes lasted for about 5 hours, slowly subsiding almost to normal again at the end, but then it was time for the next meal. Because there were three meals, about five hours apart, there were fifteen hours of abnormal EKG patterns, all subisiding by the end of the 5 hour interval, recorded on the Holter.

hu3A1B15,30-39 years,I am comfortable making my genome sequence data publicly available without prior review.,Yes,I have an expanded CAG repeat of 37 in the huntingtin gene, but am asymptomatic (at age 37). CAG repeats of 40 and above are fully penetrant for Huntington's Disease (HD), a rare, fatal neurodegenerative, autosomal dominant disease for which there currently exists no treatment. Although the most common age of onset for HD for those with 40 or more CAG repeats is the 30s, age of onset varies considerably and is inversely correlated with number of CAG repeats. That said, the number of repeats does not account for all of the variation in age of onset, and the conventional wisdom is that secondary genes likely account for the remaining variation.

CAG repeats between 35 and 39 (roughly) are associated with reduced penetrance. While clinical HD is rare, are even rarer, at least as represented in the clinic and in the literature. When I was tested, circa 2002, predictions about probability of developing HD within a normal lifetime were based, for each allele in the 35-39 range, on an n of a handful individuals. Based on that data, I was told that the 37 allele confers roughly a 50% chance of developing HD within a normal lifespan, with age of onset varying considerably among the handful of known symptomatic individuals, from the early 30s to the 80s. That said, more recent research questions the basis on which these predictions were made. It's likely that those with intermediate range alleles who are symptomatic or whose relatives (with whom they share secondary genes that may influence penetrance) are symptomatic are probably overrepresented (relative to others carrying an intermediate range allele) in the clinic and, thus, in the data. The incidence of intermediate CAG expansion is almost certainly much higher than the literature suggests, and may be higher than the incidence of 40+ CAG expansion, especially given the possibility of de novo mutations.

The parent from whom I inherited this allele also has a 37, of course, including the huntingtin gene) through 23andMe. 

The grandfather from whom I inherited the allele was asymptomatic for HD upon death (in his early 80s), but no signs of HD). That sample, sent around 2000, may still be available.

hu868880,50-59 years,I am comfortable making my genome sequence data publicly available without prior review.,Yes,Though I am only 52, I have experienced a number of significant medical issues that may well be characterized as rare or severe:

At 28 I was diagnosed with massive brain bleed and underwent a craniotomy for a partial resection of my left parietal lobe.  Though there was a significant loss of brain due to both the bleed and surgery, resulting in constant small damage, and allowing my brain to rewire itself as it developed (rather than the trauma that would result if the same area of my brain were damaged in adulthood all at once.

At 47 I was diagnosed with Kidney Cancer (renal cell carcinoma) via an incidental finding during an appendectomy follow-up.

At 48

I also started getting grey hairs at the age of 19. I'm not sure how rare this is but I'm sure there is a lot of money in this kind of research. Perhaps it could also help with hearing-loss genetic studies (inner ear hair cells failing?).

My father was an alcoholic and his father was an alcoholic.
My mother was diabetic and her mother was also diabetic.

I think that this is related to my compulsions.

It may not be rare enough for your study

My uncle has traced back my father's  family history for many generations.
I have a cousin that has traced back some of my ancestry on my mothers side in great depth. < http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=SRCH&db=pricefrielgrow&surname=P>  My mother and aunts and uncles all had Type 2. My cousin's daughter died of Type 1. 

To quote him: 
My oldest daughter Amanda was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes just before her 3rd birthday in 1978.  At the time, but she lived to 86.

Amanda suffered from another auto immune disease

I learned last year that Teresa Friel Price's older brother Leo Bernard Friel had diabetes

Also Mary Kathleen Curran

I am not aware of anyone else in the family who has been diagnosed with diabetes

My theory is some people are genetically predisposed to get Type 1 diabetes and that it takes a virus (coxsackie?) or stress to trigger it.  This gene may be in the Friel line.  I have not found anyone in the Price line with diabetes.

I would be interested to know if any of your family has diabetes.

Also, certain atypical SNP results identified by running 23andme raw data through Promethease may contribute or synergize with these effects.

QUESTION: Do you have a severe disease or rare non-disease trait you believe is strongly genetic in origin? Please describe.

William Hamilton STEWART wrote the following on 2011/Jul/26.

1) SUPER MUSCULAR STRENGTH - I have been four times stronger than most people even though I never had any athletic training

The strength of every part of the bodies of college students was tested in the 1960s as part of a national survey for military purposes. One student in my Physical Education class at the University of South Carolina always doubled the test scores of all of the other boys. I always doubled his.

I was one of the last students in my class to be tested via a scale attached to a belt that was strapped around our waists. According to that scale

I thought I would test the device to see how it felt before I tried very hard. I'll never forget the bulging eyes and expression on the face of USC football coach Lamar as I gently lifted up on that scale. He blurted out: Stewart

While my Uncle Joe STEWART and I were sitting at his kitchen table one day

My brother told me he had similar experiences. He grew several inches taller than me. My parents never abused my two brothers. My brothers and I never smoked or used alcohol and other drugs. My parents bought candy, but never for me.  One of my Stewart cousins told me he was super strong too.

How much of our strength is genetic? My childhood environment was terrible.  My parents physically and mentally abused me from the time I was a baby until I graduated from High School and left their home. They worked me like a slave and starve me on a diet of grease and grits six days a week. It made me so sick every few weeks that I vomited and could not eat. I usually became well after a few days because my mother put me in bed and fed me some fruit salad. I was hospitalized when I was five or six years old because of a bone infection of a bruise

A doctor who measured my pulse when I was a teenager said it was 39. Until a few years ago my resting heart rate was still 39.

2) FAST RUNNER - I enrolled in a jogging course at USC during the 1980s. For our final grades college students who were half my age and I had to run two miles around a square athletic field. We had to run around that field four and half laps on grass in order to run one mile. We had to slow down 18 times every mile because we were not allowed to cut corners. I ran the first mile in four and a half minutes so the two timers shouted for me to slow down. I paid no attention to them and ran the second mile in four and a half minutes too. I felt that I could run at that speed all day long. I never push myself to the limit because I do not want to risk injuring myself. I and another guy received the only A grade in that jogging course.

3) FAST SWIMMER - I won all the swimming and other athletic competitions at the camps (e.g.

4) INTELLIGENCE - The University of SC gave me some intelligence tests about 1960. I do not attribute my IQ score of about 140 to my having a better environment than most people. My mother spent her childhood working in a cotton mill. My alcoholic father could barely read and write.

5) POSSIBLE SENSITIVITY TO ELECTROMAGNETIC FORCES
* My nerves tingled so badly that I could hardly stand being swung back and forth when I was a child
* I felt the build up of an electromagnetic charge moments before I was struck by lightning in the 1970s (not strongly enough to kill me fortunately).
* The first time I attempted to use a cellular telephone it had a destructive effect on my nearby nerves and other tissues.

6) STRONG EMOTIONS - My dog had ten puppies. I love them and want them to be healthy and happy. I have wept because of the suffering and death of three of them. I also love people and science. I want our civilization to continue to survive and make progress.

7) MY ANCESTRY - All of my known maternal and paternal ancestors have lived in SC since the eighteenth century. Many of my cousins have had DNA tests. That all of them belong to Y-haplogroup R1b1a2 and to haplogroup I may mean that I am of almost 100% European

As for the others, and bipolar have all been formally diagnosed, and I am happy to share my records. I have the autistic tendency towards full disclosure to an extent that sometimes violates social norms or other's comfort level; I really don't have any problem with anyone knowing the details of me being a crazy gay smart guy to the limits of their voyeurism. I wasn't going to bother putting everything into Google Health since it's being discontinued, but since you're going to keep the data alive I might as well. That's going to take a few weeks, as I have hundred of pages of medical records already and probably a few hundred more on the way.

These tests were done by a neurologist at Kaiser Permanente in Los Angeles and I believe I could request copies of them if that would be of interest, although I have not yet done so.

From Pub Med Health:
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0002401/

Waardenburg syndrome

Klein-Waardenburg syndrome; Waardenburg-Shah syndrome
Last reviewed: August 4

Waardenburg syndrome is a group of conditions passed down through families that involve deafness and pale skin

Causes

Waardenburg syndrome is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait

There are four main types of Waardenburg syndrome. The most common are Type I and Type II.

Type III (Klein-Waardenburg syndrome) and type IV (Waardenburg-Shah syndrome) are more rare.

The multiple types of this syndrome result from defects in different genes. Most people with this disease have a parent with the disease

Symptoms

Symptoms may include:

Cleft lip (rare)

Constipation

Deafness(more common in type II disease)

Extremely pale blue eyes or eye colors that don't match (heterochromia)

Pale color skin

Difficulty completely straightening joints

Possible slight decrease in intellectual function

Wide-set eyes (in Type I)

White patch of hair or early graying of the hair

Less common types of this disease may cause problems with the arms or intestines.

Signs and tests

Tests may include:

Audiometry

Bowel transit time

Colon biopsy

Genetic testing

Treatment

There is no specific treatment. Symptoms will be treated as appropriate. Special diets and medicines to keep the bowel moving are prescribed to those patients who have constipation.

Expectations (prognosis)

Once hearing problems are corrected

Complications

Constipation severe enough to require part of large bowel to be removed

Hearing loss

Self-esteem problems

Slight decreased intellectual functioning (possible

Slight increased risk for muscle tumor called rhabdomyosarcoma

My IQ consistently tests over 160, science, and spatial reasoning.

I also have ventricular branch delay as described by a cardiologist.  I have relevant medical data and testing information for this, part of my R wave fires during my S wave creating a jaggie in the S wave.  From what I understand, this is a rare, but trivial, electrical defect in the heart, though a cardiologist would have to comment on this further.  There is a strong history of heart related illness in my family, so it is very possible this is genetically linked.

I have recently been diagnosed with migraines

I was tested at age 18 to have 115% of normal tidal volume for my external body measurements

hu6D1115,60-69 years,I am comfortable making my genome sequence data publicly available without prior review.,Yes,It is not that rare, but potentially severe. I'm hetrozygous for MTHFR C677T. When I was diagnosed in 1998, my homocysteine level was 48. That is pretty high for a CT. There have to be multiple factors at work to drive my homocysteine level so high. It isn't my diet as I'm a healthy eater. What could they be? Recently I came across a study that sheds some light on my question. I found out that in combination with MTFHR 677>CT, I am a homozygous CC for SLC19A1 rs819130 which supposedly causes a 10% increase of homocysteine levels in carriers on top of whatever effect the MTHFR>CT has. rs819130 is a folate transporter, but in CCs, not efficient. As far as I can tell, no one quite has a handle on high homocysteine yet. I follow the research avidly hoping to find out as much as I can about my condition, so I can figure out how to moderate my epigenome to counteract the effects. I've seen what it did to my father, my uncle and my grandmother. I'm aware of what it did to my great-grandmother. None of them lived long enough to be affected by late onset Alzheimer's but high homocysteine is a risk factor. Alzheimer's is definitely a fate I wish to avoid. So far I think my best bet is strenuous daily exercise and reducing my calorie and sugar intake. I also have risk factors for diabetes, so I've been trying to eat like a diabetic as best I can.
All the people in my family who share the high homocysteine trait are now deceased, and they think he's probably getting the placebo. His wife is planning to take hin to China for a stem cell transplant. However, I doubt that his issue is related to mine. I wouldn't dare ask him to enroll in PGP at this point.
,Moderate severity disease,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,I have genetic tests from Berkeley Heart Lab and Health Diagnostic Laboratory that confirm MTFHR 677>CT. I have a subscription to 23and me that allows me to browse raw date, so I'm able to correlate my condition to the latest genetic research on high homocysteine. I was first tipped off to my condition after my father had a heart attack in Canada. His cardiologist told him he had the highest level of homocysteine that had ever been tested in the lab that covers all of Western Canada and that his condition was genetic and all his children should be test for it. None of my sisters have it. I'm not sure about my brother, but I don't think he does either.

I was born a raised in Puerto Rico, and can trace my ancestry back on the island for 8 generations. I think it would be very interesting to find out if I have this variant, and other variants in my genome that are specific to Taino acestry [2]

I am of Irish descent on both sides

When I drink

When I was an active drinker, very early in the evening. Even when drinking alone, I would exhibit the same pattern.

My hypothesis is this: 

I am probably deficient in one of the enzymes that convert acetaldehyde (ACL) to CO2 and H2O. 

As the ACL builds up in my system, symptoms which another drink will mask. The result is a very heavy dose of alcohol in a short time, and a build up of ACL to virtual toxic levels, which my body then takes around 24 hours to clear, resulting in a severe, interminable hangover.

Although I cannot provide references, and have read that it is related to an ACL enzyme deficiency common among Irish people.

Although these are common skin cancers to get, it is rare for an individual to have so many as my mother, and I suspect given that I have had two before the age of 50 that I will have similar problems.,40-49 years of age,Fairly common,Moderate severity disease,Maybe,Yes,No,Yes,screen shots of medical files,Male,White,United States,United States,United States,United States,No,,Maybe,,
hu1843FC,40-49 years,I am NOT comfortable making my genome sequence data publicly available without prior review.,Yes,I have tested positive as a Tay Sachs carrier, as has a cousin on my father's side of the family.  My mother is not a carrier per her testing, which means my father is, though he hasn't been tested.

I also have recently been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, I do not have the typical early symptoms.  I believe whatever I do have is genetic in nature because my mother was also diagnosed with MS around the same age. Her symptoms were more compelling in that she had visual issues as well as white matter brain lesions similar to mine, but she only had 3 protein bands.  She, too, had cognitive impairment but never took meds and was later told that she had a single incident rather than the disease.  However, when I took her records to my MS doctor, a leading doctor in the field, he said that she would now still be considered to have MS due to the current criteria.,Congenital / present at birth,Uncommon,Not applicable,Maybe,Yes,Yes,Yes,I believe that I could access the genetic testing that I had done that verifies I am a tay sachs carrier.

huD7960A,60-69 years,I am comfortable making my genome sequence data publicly available without prior review.,Yes,I have been diagnosed with hypokalemic periodic paralysis, which affects about 1 in 100,000 people. HypoK-PP is an ion channel disorder that dangerously manifests with the use of hospital medications but also in response to food and the body's own internal chemistry. 

About 70% of HypoK-PP patients have a known genetic mutation. I am in the 30%

In HypoK-PP, and dangerous unexpected paralytic responses to medications in the hospital, for instance, where I am unexpectedly paralyzed and unable to move, including breathing muscles. 

I could not call out, my oxygen status was being monitored. After I lost consciousness due to anoxia, the team came in and provided mechanical breathing assistance. My breathing was not back to normal for several days. This is not the only hospital emergency like this that I have experienced -- this team was trying their hardest to avoid this type of problem, but we had the problem anyway. 

Episodes started in my late teens (1970) in response to food, but not eliminate them. 

On a Holter monitor (in 2009) the EKG components of my episodes were measured. Starting in a fasting state, with a pulse rate of about 59 beats per minute. Within a half hour the episode is apparent, with many PVC's (premature ventricular contractions), other arrhythmias, and then tachycardia, going up to a resting pulse rate of about 128 bpm. The EKG's also showed breathing difficulty. 

That day the episodes resolved in about five hours, slowly resolving in five hours each, that day. 

I am otherwise very healthy,Very rare/uncommon,Very severe disease,Maybe,Yes,No,Yes,1. I have excerpts from the 2009 Holter data that show the EKG's in response to food. 

2. I have strength tests over time

3. Finally

It is similar to a modified glucose tolerance test, over time, various measurements are taken. 

Measurements included strength (walking speed on treadmill), serum potassium, also comments by cardiologist over time. 

There were some very unusual results -- my fasting insulin levels started at about 8% of normal (I started at around 0.6 microunits per ml, I lost 1/4 of my walking speed, and was barely able to walk by the time insulin levels rose to 5 microunits per ml. In normal subjects, postprandial insulin levels can easily go up to 140 microunits per ml. Mine rose up to about 35 microunits per ml. 

I was not ok again until the insulin levels fell down below 3.0 microunits per ml. 

The potassium shift into the tissues, falling from 4.2 mEq down to 3.5, and then coming up to 3.9 -- all in the normal range. There were PVC's and arrhythmias during the test, too. 

This was not a severe attack

I submitted the following information via the web page at https://spreadsheets.google.com/spreadsheet/formResponse?hl=en_US&formkey=dHRaNUxmUHdVaktxZXdsRlVyMlIwUUE6MQ&ifq

I must have an unusual genetic characteristic. No one with whom I have ever discussed the issue experienced the earth's magnetic field

Everyone must be sensitive to electromagnetic forces to some degree, could our muscles contract, or our brains think?

I must be extra sensitive to electromagnetic fields and forces

I have travelled in over seventy countries, I have never felt lost. I always know where I am and how to get home.

When I was a child swinging back and forth in a swing caused me to feel as though my entire body was being tickled. The sensation was unbearable. I thought every child felt the same sensations. Later experiences caused me to ask other people if swinging back and forth caused their bodies to tingle when they were children. All of them have replied NO.

Many years later I sensed the heavy electro-magnetic forces that were building up in the atmosphere around me a few seconds before a mild bolt of lighting ran through my body. That lighting exited via my feet and some metal tools that I held in my hands (my fingers remained sore for a long time afterwards).

I wonder why I inherited these unusual characteristics. I am interested in genetic genealogy. My DNA tests and those of my cousins show that nearly all of my ancestors were Celts and Vikings from Scotland and Ireland. The Vikings sailed to America centuries before Columbus. I wonder if evolution caused them to develop some of the same genetic characteristics that whales

I bought a cheap cell phone a few years ago. I do not know if it was defective. My hands tingled when it rang or transmitted signals to the tower. The first and only call that I ever made via that cell phone lasted 52 minutes. Towards the end of that call I felt something creeping up the left side of my head (where I held the phone). The sensation became so awful that I ended the call without saying Goodbye. The left side of my head hurt so bad that I thought that I had a toothache or flu infection at first. The pain became unbearable and lasted for many years. My left eye stopped blinking. I am no longer able to focus my left eye. A large scab developed where I held the phone. The skin where I held the phone was discolored. I had tinnitus for years. The tissues in the left side of my head were damaged in other ways too. I shall not bore you with all the details.

I hope that whatever genes caused me to be so sensitive to electromagnetic forces will be discovered so that people who inherited them can be made aware of how cell phone use may affect them.

huED0F40,40-49 years,I am comfortable making my genome sequence data publicly available without prior review.,Yes,My 11-year-old son was just diagnosed with scoliosis, becoming the third generation diagnosed with spinal malformation. My son also has periodic low HDL in blood draws. While researching causes of kyphosis to prep for my son's fall 2012 orthopedic evaluation, I discovered Marfans Syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos and other genetic connective disorders for the first time. Since early childhood, I could bend my thumbs and hand far back, pop both my knee caps in & out of joint, and I could wrap my legs into a lotus position and then lift my crossed legs to touch my chest, multiple times like a seated situp. My father's 1995 severe mitral valve prolapse echocardiogram with enlarged aortic stem, his (and my) history of early arthritis detected in the spine, his very low body weight (143 - 150 lbs almost all of his adult life (until it went lower in his 60s) despite being 6'4 with long slender limbs & fingers, and a family history among uncles of hip dysplasia, multiple hiatal and inguinal hernias and chronic pain all made sense related to a connective tissue disorder: either Marfans or EDS. My geneticist visit is not until Spring 2013 at Johns Hopkins Hospital, but my Aug/Sep 2012 opthamologist, cardiology, radiology tests are all showing signs of connective tissue disorder of some kind, more like Ehlers-Danlos in my case (I.e. no aortic stem enlargement on my own 2012 echogram and only mitral valve degeneration, not full prolapse-- my father was 66 when his first echo was done and he died before a followup was done.). Most of the men on my father's side of the family tend to die months ahead of or after turning 67, despite different levels of healthful behavior, levels of medical care, etc. going back to the 1920s, as though parts have worn out at that age.,10-19 years of age,Uncommon,Moderate severity disease

Sinai, which are not conclusive, since there are many unique mutations of Porphyria that have not been documented, due to limited availability (only Mt.

hu76CAA5,50-59 years,I am comfortable making my genome sequence data publicly available without prior review.,Yes,Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Currently dependent on propafenone to suppress the malignant. Recurrence of atrial fibrillation invariably leads to rapid ventricular response requiring emergency cardioversion (will not convert with IV medication regimen). The invariable rapid ventricular response is the component that distinguishes it from typical atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation is always malignant for me, which is why I am dependent on propafenone extended release (a very expensive medication) versus anticoagulation with Coumadin. The Coumadin can reduce the  stroke risk, but does nothing to control the tachycardia of 130-140 associated with the atrial fibrillation. I live a normal life as long as I have access to the propfenone extended release.

The first tumor was:

Low grad spindle cell metaplastic carcinoma arising from a sclerosed papilloma with and in situ squamous cell carcinoma component.

The second tumor was:

Microscopic examination reveals a malignant neoplasm, CK 34BE12, CK 5/6 and p63 in the later areas and only focal staining in the spindle cell areas. The tumor cells are also strongly positive for vimentin, and negative for s-100, CD34 and SMA. 
Proliferation index (Ki-67) is positive
Ki67 clone MIB (Dako).
The morphologic features and the IHC results are consistent with metaplastic carcinoma with areas of spindle cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma

I only found out that it was not normal recently. I knew I looked different to other men, but did not know what was wrong. I went to a urologist for help with an enlarged prostate and trouble urinating and erectile dysfunction and he told me that my penis was deformed and explained what was wrong. I read about it on the Wikipedia web site and apparently it is not that rare, but there are severe cases that require surgery. I am uncircumcised or partly circumcised and I read that could have contributed to the problem. However, I think most are a birth defect.Perhaps you could shed some light on this or confirm or deny my findings.,,,,,,,,,Male,White,United States,United States,United States,United States,,,,,

huC11596,1979,,,Familial dominant neuromuscular disorder - not yet identified - neurologist is about to ship me off to UMD and from there, if no answers, to NIH (which is where previous neuro tried to send me immediately).  

Myotonia + myalgia from early childhood, hunger (particularly lack of refined carbs/sugar), and ESPECIALLY inactivity.  Made better by moderate exercise, but with a rebound effect after too much exercise.  Also improved with heat and massage (but not stretching).  Very low lactate threshold.  Hyperreflexia in me, but according to mother, grandmother (with same condition) had complete areflexia from her teens.  Mother and grandmother both have/had pronounced peripheral neuropathy, and my last workup found some, too.  I've had parasthesia, fasculation, and neuralgia (the last I believe from nerve impingement due to chronic myotonia), but these largely resolved with large amounts of moderate exercise.  MRI was clean.  Action tremor from teenage years at least (others noticed and commented first).  No impact on intelligence with age (mother scored in 99.99th %ile on the GRE at 50, as I did at 22, back when it was actually hard).

No cardiac or smooth muscle abnormalities at all.

A small mutation of my SCN1A gene was found of unknown importance.  Other than that, as I said above, I suspect are largely caused by irritation or impingement on the nerves by the badly behaved voluntary muscles, NOT because of some kind of nerve disorder, CNS or otherwise.  Another doctor's pet theory is a mitochondrial metabolic disorder, which I find pretty unlikely given its dominant inheritance.,,,,,,,,,Female,White,United States,United States,United States,United States,,,,,,,,

On my father's side, there have been several heart-related issues.  They have seemed to not be as prevalant since diets have changed in a few generations of relatives.  On my mother's side, my uncle, first cousin, and a farther back relative have all suffered some sort of schizo spectrum disorder.  I know personally that my first cousin's schizophrenia was triggered by him using methamphetamine and various other drugs.  I thought I was going to end up the same because of my alcoholism and family genetics, but have absolutely no paranoia or any related symptoms.,,,,,,,,,Male,American Indian / Alaska Native, White,United States,United States,United States,United States

hu4EEA9B,1986,,,My family has very diverse ethnicities.  I have tried to trace this down since I was a child, and have recently compared my DNA with several populations.  If you would like the results to this data, I'll be glad to email them.  My ethnic profile is primarily Western European, with a lot of Mediterranean.  I have been told that I have a lot of Greco-Italian genes, but that I am mostly a Euro-mutt.  I also have some Native American ethnicity.  My DNA analyses have shown roughly 9% likelihood of Middle/Near Eastern genetics from the SNP comparisons, and is most likely due to the amount of relatives I've had from the Mediterranean area (most likely mingled with Middle Eastern Jewish populations).  From my best guess, my ancestry runs through every population except African and East Asian ethnic groups.,,,,,,,,,Male,American Indian / Alaska Native, White,United States,United States,United States,United States,,

My tolerance for medication seems to increase faster than normal people and it seems impossible to get it to go back to normal no matter how long I've been off the meds. I have an addictive personality, low-self esteem, have self-medicated in the past. Addiction (specifically alcoholism) has run in my family since, at least, before the Civil War as noted by great-great-great (?) grandfather Dr. Jacob Perry Welch who wrote a journal for posterity. I also suffer from insufferable anxiety.,,,,,,,,,Female,White,United States,United States,United States,United States,,,,,
