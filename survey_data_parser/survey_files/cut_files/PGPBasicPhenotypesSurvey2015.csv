Some of my four children's eyes (all blue or blue with hazel rings or flecks) have lightened through the years (oldest is only 12, youngest not yet four).  My younger sister's blue eyes lightened a lot more than mine, and I've noticed the two of my children with hazel elements in their blue eyes have had their blue lighten up more than the other two.  My nearly-four-year-old daughter has dark blue eyes and looks almost identical to what I did at that age (not just eyes, but overall).  I doubt hers will lighten much; they haven't yet.

My paternal side of family are all blue-eyed, and while some reached adulthood with medium to dark blue, others' eyes lightened, to end up with light-medium (no really light/pale blues in our family).  In general, but there may be exceptions, I've observed through the years that the dark-haired (med to dark brown) ones of us have kept a darker spectrum of blue in our eyes, while the lighter-haired (light brown to blonde) members tend to be the ones whose eyes have lightened more.

Last child has maintained dark-medium brown hair since birth to current age of nearly four.,My maternal grandmother was a native of England, Irish descent.

Dark amber radiating from pupils to light gold and green, grey-brown outer ring; light grey-blue halo in white ,Same,Father is African American with dark brown eyes (skin tone like Bill Cosby); mother is Caucasian (German/Welsh- skin tone pinkish/ruddy pale) with light cornflower blue eyes. My only sibling (older brother) looks more biracial (darker skin tone with afro and brown eyes) but strong large build favoring my mother's side. My skin and hair are primarily light beige gold, and my eyes have always been a green-amber hazel. The grey-blue halo presented at about age 42, which is also when I began to get white hair growing in. No eye diseases in my family, although we are all nearsighted. 

My father recently was diagnosed with cataracts, although my father's renal disease has caused yellowing to his eyes.,blonde,naturally beige blone with ash tones- recently greying around temples in a shocking white shade from temples to crown and a few single strands beyond that. ,Born with reddish orange hair, turned bright blonde from ages 2-4 then went back to an orange blonde age 5-6, back to golden blonde thereafter, progressing to more beige in my 30's and now os beige with golden blonde accents. I'm told the undertone is ash, but I don't know what that means. It's a strange color, but never dark enough to be brown. The grey hair coming in from temple to temple started at age 42 and is more a bright and white, straight some spots and obnoxiously curly in others, only going back 1/4 inches into my crown area. Very annoying. Hair on legs and arms has always been fine light gold blonde.,I'm biracial, and even though my features strongly favor my father's side (who is black) My skin, hair, eyecolor, height and weight only resemble some cousins through my paternal grandmother's side. Obviously, slavery in America created the light hair, skin and eyes my cousins and I share. My white mother was a brunette, but there were some blondes on her side. So I basically picked up only the recessive genes in my parents and have no idea why so many showed up in me, whereas my older brother is a more obvious blend of our parents. There is no error in the DNA - this is my actual blood family- but I look like an odd duck because of my small size, light hair skin and eyes.,Right

Overall, my hair is very dark, to a near black at it's current state.  During high school, I began to notice a few grey strands.  Also, at the crown of my scalp, there are two opposing-direction cowlicks (double cowlick).  Fine, thin hair.  Body hair is almost nonexistent.  Pores are very effective at keeping me running cool, and is likely because of my lack of being hairy.  Perhaps some research into that subject would benefit science.  Hairy creatures generally have to pant to relieve body heat due to lack of sweat glands, perhaps less hair equals more (or more effective) sweat glands.  I do sweat very frequently.,Just thought I'd re-take this survey to add my blog type (A Pos).

my dad has weird grey eyes. I don't know what his looked like when he was young

my dad has one eye that rolls sideways

my daughter was diagnosed with retinal migraines in addition to her eye roll. she was also born pretty strongly farsighted. my dad wears a super strong prescription as well but I don't know his specifics.

my left eye doesn't close all the way and I have to cover it when I sleep

my daughter didn't open her eyes at all for the first six weeks or so after she was born and then she slept with her eyes completely open every night until she was about 15 months old.

my daughter and I definitely see colors differently but I don't know which of us has any colorblindness. ,my hair was light blonde until I was 7 or 8. then people described it as dirty blonde for a lot of years, and now it's unambiguously just brown. I have some streaks that showed dark when my hair was light and showed light when my hair got darker, but i think the streaks were always the same color. they were visible enough on my scalp when i was an infant that hospital staff thought it was vernix and tried to scrub them off. when i shaved my head in my teens i could still see the stripes on my head, but when i shaved it this summer I couldn't see them. I do still get asked if I bleached highlights in even though I can't find the blonde streaks when i look in the mirror.

my beard is a mix of brown, silver, and black,my dad's hair went from black to completely white in his early thirties. he looked like steve martin. i have more silver hairs than other thirtysomethings I know but nothing like my dad.

i am the only one i've met in my immediate or extended family to have hair like mine. my mom and sister have dark brown curly hair with dark brown eyes and my brother has bright red curly hair with light green eyes. all my mom's family I've met have either black or red hair or it's gone white and I don't know what color it used to be. my dad's side is all dark brown and black and they all seem to have blue or grey eyes.

My mother's eyes changed from brown to ringed grey, to solid crystal blue, and later in life far sighted.  My father's eyes were always hazel, and he was several times legally blind from near nearsightedness.  The older of my two younger sisters was born with grey eyes which became ringed, and then solid crystal blue.  My youngest sister always had solid crystal blue eyes.

The hairline on my forehead receded while I was homeless, keeping my hair in a pony tail, and unable to wash it regularly.  It has stopped receding since returning to proper hygiene.,My diet as a child did not include Essential Fatty Acids, such as fish or seeds, or oils.
